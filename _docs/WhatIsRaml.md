# What is RAML?

RAML is an API specification language developed by [MuleSoft](https://www.mulesoft.com/) based on YAML.  

It is a language for the definition of HTTP-based APIs that embody most or all of the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST). This document constitutes the RAML specification, an application of the YAML 1.2 specification. The RAML specification provides mechanisms for defining practically-RESTful APIs, creating client/server source code, and comprehensively documenting the APIs for users.
